# OASIS Document Types

Test to ensure that every document type provided by OASIS compiles,
in the various supported formats.

For now `allgrammars.ditamap` refers to all doctypes using all DITA 1.3
versions of the OASIS DITA DTDs and XSDs.

Because RNG still requires a bit of extra setup with DITA-OT, I've kept RNG
a separate map, `rnggrammars.ditamap`, which refers to all RNG doctypes
using all variants of DITA 1.3 IDs.
